# TIC-TAC-TOE-GAME

A Flutter project.

## OBJECTIVE:
This project for Data Day Grind 3.0:  with a aims to develop a Tic Tac Toe game using Flutter. It mainly consists of developing a Tic Tac Toe game.
In order to understand what Tic Tac Toe game is and how to play the game, below is the description.

### GAME DESCRIPTION:
Tic Tac Toe is a two-player game. In this game, there is a board with 3 x 3 squares.

The two players take turns putting marks on a 3x3 board. The goal of Tic Tac Toe game is to be one of the players to get three same symbols in a row - horizontally, vertically or diagonally on a 3 x 3 grid. The player who first gets 3 of his/her symbols (marks) in a row - vertically, horizontally, or diagonally wins the game, and the other loses the game. The game can be played by two players. 

### GAME RULES:
A player can choose between two symbols with his opponent, usual game uses ‚ÄúX‚Äù and ‚ÄúO‚Äù.

The player that gets to play first will get the "X" mark (we call him/her player 1) and the player that gets to play second will get the "O" mark (we call him/her player 2).

Player 1 and 2 take turns making moves with Player 1 playing mark ‚ÄúX‚Äù and Player 2 playing mark ‚ÄúO‚Äù.

A player marks any of the 3x3 squares with his mark (‚ÄúX‚Äù or ‚ÄúO‚Äù) and their aim is to create a straight line horizontally, vertically or diagonally with two intensions:
a. One of the players gets three of his/her marks in a row (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) i.e. that player wins the game.
b. If no one can create a straight line with their own mark and all the positions on the board are occupied, then the game ends in a draw/tie.
